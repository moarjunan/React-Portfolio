# Mo's React Portfolio

My React Portfolio

Bootcamp Challenge 20: React

## Description

This portfolio application has been crafted to exhibit my web applications, resume, and skills for the benefit of potential employers, clients, and other interested individuals. Built with React, an open-source JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces, and Material-UI, a widely-used component library that adheres to Google's Material Design principles, this portfolio aims to provide a seamless and visually appealing showcase.

React, developed by Facebook, simplifies the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces through its component-based structure, efficient rendering using the virtual DOM, and a declarative syntax. Although operating as a one-page application, it offers users the experience of navigating through multiple pages.
